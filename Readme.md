Visual depiction of social trends.

## Problem statement
People throughout the world want to know the most pressing social issues and trends happening in real time.

## How will your project solve this problem?
Our project will solve this issue by providing users an intuitive visual display of trending topics.
This will enable users to gather and interpret relevant information to become more informed citizens of the world.

## Map the user experience
1. Users will visit the site and be met with a visual experience of the current trending topics pulled from media outlets.
2. The size of the visual components will be based on the volume of traffic to said issue. The visual components will be similar to the word cloud image below.
The unique aspect of this is as opposed to words, the social cloud will be made up of images and stories that will be clickable links to the trending content.
